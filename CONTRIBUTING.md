# Contributing to LynxScript
We welcome contributions to the LynxScript project! If you're interested in improving the language, parser, interpreter, or CLI, please consider the following:

- Open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. This helps ensure that your contribution aligns with the project's goals and avoids duplicate efforts.
- When the discussing is done and you are ready to move onto the next stage, fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
- Ensure your Rust code changes passes `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
- Write new tests for any new features you implemented, while ensure all the pre-existing tests pass.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
- We will review your pull request and provide feedback. Once it's approved, we will merge it into the `main` branch.
